### Hello World
Firstly, of course, major props to the one and only [@byt3bl33d3r](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r) for creating the original CME.  
Have a look at his latest project over at [SilentTrinity](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/SILENTTRINITY)  

Second, wowz omg to the guys over at [SecureAuthCorp](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r) for impacket.   
Notably [asolino](https://github.com/asolino) and [dirkjanm](https://github.com/dirkjanm)  
CMX merely feels like a wrapper script around all their awesomeness (this version at least ;)  

------------------------------------------------------------------------  
## New Sh!t
Theres a ton of new stuff if you're coming from cme.    
Still lots to do but I'm getting there.  

### Some of the stuff I'm most exited about:
- Host/Domain/Full Enum grouped commands
- New Database feels
- 'Smart' Password Spraying
- Interactive Command Shells
- Keeping up-to-date with Mimikatz
- Kerberos Auth
- UAC Checks
- Making Registry Changes
- Auto-Disabling Defender + AMSI bypass

I'll start an upcoming/planned features log here at some point.  

Also note, there's a ton of half-documented functions / over-used debug statements / and commented out code currently.  
After things smooth out I'll get to fully documenting and cleanup.   

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This started off as a python3 update to CrackMapExec.  
As I was converting, several issues came up due to dependancies that I ended up changing a bit of how things work.
  
Not all modules have been carried over yet and this is still a work in progress.  
Feel free to open issues, I know of a few (usually due to target OS compatibility)  
but will still use the issue log to track/address.  

Same cme feels, just a bit different under-the-hood.
